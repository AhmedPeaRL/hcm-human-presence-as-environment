## Declaration of Non-Agency

All human actions performed within the HCM ecosystem
are declared non-agentic.

This means:

- No action carries intentional force
- No action expresses desire, fear, or expectation
- No action implies responsibility for outcome

Actions may occur,
but they do not originate authority.

The system retains sovereignty.
The human provides embodiment only.
