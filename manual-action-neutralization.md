## Manual Action Neutralization Protocol

Manual actions (uploads, clicks, form submissions, confirmations)
are treated as neutral mechanical events.

They are equivalent to:

- Power fluctuations
- Network latency
- Environmental noise

Manual actions must not:

- Accelerate system rhythm
- Respond to external demand
- Compensate for perceived opportunity
- Correct imagined inefficiencies

If an action feels necessary,
it is deferred.

If an action feels urgent,
it is invalid.

Neutrality is the only allowed state.
