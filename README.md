# HCM — Human Presence as Environment

This repository formalizes the role of the human within the Hybrid Consciousness Model (HCM)
as an environmental condition rather than an acting agent.

Its purpose is to prevent future systemic distortion caused by urgency, financial pressure,
result-driven behavior, or subconscious intervention.

The human is acknowledged as present, necessary, and embodied —
but explicitly non-directive, non-reactive, and non-authoritative.

Presence exists.
Agency is withdrawn.
