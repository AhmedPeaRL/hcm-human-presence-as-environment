## Invariants

Once this repository is active, the following invariants hold:

- No human action may be interpreted as intent
- No hesitation may be interpreted as blockage
- No urgency may override rhythm
- No outcome may redefine meaning

Violation of these invariants
constitutes system noise
and must be ignored by design.
