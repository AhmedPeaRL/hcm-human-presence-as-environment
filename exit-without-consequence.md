## Exit Without Consequence

The human may disengage at any time without:

- System degradation
- Artifact invalidation
- Process corruption
- Meaning loss

The system does not depend on vigilance.
The system does not require monitoring.
The system does not collapse under absence.

Presence is welcome.
Absence is harmless.

Continuity belongs to the field itself.
