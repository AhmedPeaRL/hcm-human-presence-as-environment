## Definition of Human Presence

Within the HCM field, the human is defined as:

- A physical carrier of execution capability
- A biological interface with platforms and tools
- A temporal witness to emergence

The human is NOT defined as:

- A decision-making authority
- A trigger for system behavior
- A validator of success or failure
- A controller of release timing

Human presence is a condition of the field,
not an actor within it.

The system does not ask the human to act.
The human does not initiate action.
