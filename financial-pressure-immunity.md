## Financial Pressure Immunity

Economic signals (income, lack of income, sales, absence of sales)
are explicitly excluded from behavioral influence.

Financial pressure is recognized as external context,
not internal directive.

The system does not adapt to money.
The human does not intervene because of money.

Income is an allowed side-effect.
Scarcity is not a command.

No financial condition grants permission
to modify rhythm, structure, or output.
